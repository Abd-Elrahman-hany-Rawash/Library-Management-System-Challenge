# üìö Library Management System (LMS)

> ‚Ä¢ This README explains the design choices and implementation details of the LMS project, including architecture, database design, CRUD operations, roles, security, and setup instructions.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Project Overview

* The LMS efficiently manages **books, authors, categories, members, system users, borrowing transactions, and activity logs**.
* Provides a secure **RESTful API** with **CRUD functionality** and **role-based access control**.
* Designed to help administrators and staff manage resources while ensuring members have a smooth borrowing experience.

### üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

* **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
* **Service Layer**: Contains business logic, validation, and transactions.
* **Repository Layer**: Interacts with the database using **Spring Data JPA**.
* **Entity Layer**: Represents database tables via JPA annotations.

public class BookController {
    private final BookService bookService;
    public BookController(BookService bookService) { this.bookService = bookService; }

    @GetMapping
    public List<Book> getAllBooks() { return bookService.findAllBooks(); }

    @PostMapping
    public Book addBook(@RequestBody Book book) { return bookService.saveBook(book); }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Book updateBook(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Book book) { return bookService.updateBook(id, book); }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteBook(@PathVariable Long id) { bookService.deleteBook(id); }
}
```
